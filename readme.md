# Computer Oriented Numerical Methods - EE543

The following is the content of EE543 of my Undergraduate degree course. We were required to take up one problem statement every week and code the C-implementations for the same. 

## Introduction

In this laboratory, students are expected to get hands-on experiences on algorithm development and program development using C for solving numerical problem of electrical engineering. This laboratory also provide foundation for solution techniques of electrical engineering problems in higher semesters. 

## Course Goal and Objectives

The course is designed to allow students to develop logical thinking for writing codes to solve a particular problem using C. The laboratory course is also complimentary to the theoretical class room teaching. More explicitly, the class objectives are:

1. To apply C-programming for solving complex numerical problems of electrical engineering
2. Develop alternative programs to realize the same task

## Lab 1: Revision of Labs performed in EE441 

In this lab students will write computer programming that were taught in EE441, Advanced Computer Programming & Data Structure 

Emphasis will be given in this lab to write C-programs for Matrix multiplication, File operation, Functions, Pointers, Dynamic memory allocation, structures and Data structures.

## Lab 2: 	Solution of Single variable non-linear Algebraic & Transcendental Equation

Lab 2 will consists of developing algorithm and writing codes to find solution of single variable Algebraic & Transcendental Equation using

1. 	Bisection method
2. 	Regula-Falsi Method
3. 	Newton-Raphson method

Students are to write Codes for each of the method should be written as functions.  Same equation to be solved by the three methods and then compare the results by taking same initial value and same accuracy in terms of:

* Number of iterations required 
* Accuracy of the results for a fixed number of iterations for each methods.  

Results to be presented in tabular form.

## Lab 3: Solution of a set of linear equation using L-U factorization

To write C-program for finding L-U factor of the co-efficient matrix of a set of linear equation.  Then using this L-U factor student will find the solution of the set of equation using forward substitution and back substitution.  

## Lab 4: Solution of a set of linear simultaneous equation using Gauss-Seidel method

The student will learn the iterative process of solving a set of linear algebraic equation using Gauss-Seidel Method by writing C-codes. Before the start of the process of iteration, the algorithm for partial pivoting should be carried out.

The written codes to be tested for at least three different sets of equation. The students should also see the difference of solution with and without performing the partial pivoting.

## Lab 5:  Solution of  non-linear equation using N-R method
This lab is aimed at developing concept of Newton Raphson Iteration method for solution of non-linear equation.  The student will develop algorithm and write C-codes for solution of:

1. Single variable non –linear equation
1. A set of non-linear equations

The written codes to be tested for at least two different sets of equation  each for single variable and set of non-linear equations.

## Lab 6:	Numerical Integration
* To write C-code to find the integration of the given tabular value (stored in a file)  using Trapezoidal rule
* To write C-code to find the integration of the given tabular value (stored in a file)  using Simpson’s 1/3 rd rule

Both the rules are to be used for the same set of data values and the results are to be compared.

## Lab 7: 	 Numerical Solution of differential equations using Taylor series
To write C-codes to find the solution of an ODE using Taylor series.
